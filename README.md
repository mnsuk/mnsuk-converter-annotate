# mnsuk-converter-annotate

This converter is an alternative to the standard "IBM Content Analytics Annotation" converter. The standard converter can require the user to also configure an additional custom converter to post-process the results returned into valid vxml. This converter returns valid vxml and removes the need for that additional development.
